# NUT-14: Optional WebSocket communication

`optional`

---

This NUT describes an additional communication protocol between wallets / apps and mints based on WebSocket, that allows for live and bi-directional interaction.

## Signaling Support via NUT-06

NUT-14 is optional. Mints can signal support via NUT-06 and it's `/info` endpoint. Furthermore mints might choose to support only certain endpoints on the optional WebSocket protocol.
The `nuts` key of `GetInfoResponse` for NUT-14 looks as follows17:

```json
"nuts": {
    "14": {
      "supported": [
        ["4"]
      ],
    },
```

This example shows a Mint signaling support of the optional WebSocket protocol only for NUT-04

## Specifications

All requests sent from apps to mints over the optional Websocket communication protocol MUST look like this

```json
["REQ", "<REQ ID>", "<NUT>", "<PARAMS>"]
```

All responses / messages sent from mints to apps MUST look like this

```json
["RES", "<REQ ID>", "<DATA>"]
```

`PARAMS` and `DATA` for each NUT are defined below.

### NUT-04

PARAMS

```json
{
method: <method>,
params: ["amount": <int>, "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>]
}
```

DATA

```json
{
